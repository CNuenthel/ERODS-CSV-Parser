To use the ERODS CSV Checker:

You must have Python downloaded and installed on your machine.
If you do not have Python you can download it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once downloaded and installed: 

1. Run the program > ERODS_CSV_Checker

A window will open up waiting for a command. Move to ERODS.
In ERODS:

1. Open your desired ERODS file
2. Click File > Download Event List as CSV
3. Save the file to the same folder that the ERODS checker is in
4. Name the file a simple name such as "1" or "Lastname"

In the CSV Checker window, type in the command "run()"

This will show your files in the directory. Type in the name of the file
you would like to review.

The CSV Checker will then return information for dates and times
in which the logbook data shows PC events, Unidentified events, and 
Inactive changed events. 

If nothing is shown other than "Complete", then no events were observed
that matched the mentioned criteria.
